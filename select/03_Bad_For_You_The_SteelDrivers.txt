Lookie here what's it caught in my smoke
Tryin' to play it off like I don't know
Thinkin' 'bout love, thinkin' you can handle me
Ooh, little girl, ain't your momma ever warned you?
I's a full-grown man the day you were born
Yeah, you're definitely a little too naive

'Cause I'm bad for you
I'll put the hurt on you
Like a midnight, all night
Blowing through the crossing lines
Don't mean nothing to a bullet train
If you know what's good for you
You'll step aside and let me roll on through
'Cause I'm bad for you

You want your tender heart,
[?] to hell and back?
You wanna fall apart?
Baby, I'm good at that
Think you can hang, girl?
I'm pretty sure you can't
And then you count on me to tell you the truth

I'm bad for you
I'll put the hurt on you
Like a midnight, all night
Blowing through the crossing lines
Don't mean nothing to a bullet train
If you know what's good for you
You'll step aside and let me roll on through
'Cause I'm bad for you

I'm bad for you
I'll put the hurt on you
Like a midnight, all night
Blowing through the crossing lines
Don't mean nothing to a bullet train
Like too many cigarettes
Too many shots of that whiskey
It'll get ya
If you know what's good for you
You'll step aside and let me roll on through
'Cause I'm bad for you

I'm bad for you
(Oh, baby, I'm bad for you)
I'm bad for you
(Oh, honey, I'm bad)
I'm bad for you
(Oh, baby)
I'm bad for you
