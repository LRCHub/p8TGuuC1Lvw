To see you there cryin' boy brings to mind
All the things I've told you one time
I told you she'd hurt you and leave more regret
And more heartache than you could ever forget

So sit there and cry boy the way that I did one time
And wish you could die boy to get that woman off of your mind
Go on and fall all to pieces son the way that she made me do
I know what you're goin' through and I feel for you
You took her from me you've thought you'd found
The woman to fill your whole world around
I'd tried to tell you but you wouldn't see
She'd leave you for someone the way she did me

Now sit there and cry boy the way that I did one time
And wish you could die boy to get that woman off of your mind
Go on and fall all to pieces son the way that she made me do
I know what you're goin' through and I feel for you

Yes I know what you're goin' through and I feel for you
